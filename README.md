**Project Description:**

The project aims to develop a simple QR code generator using Python. QR (Quick Response) codes that can encode various types of data, such as text, URLs, or contact information. 
The generator will allow users to input their desired data and generate a QR code image that can be saved or displayed.

**Key Features:**

**User Input:** Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input the data they want to encode into the QR code. This could include text, URLs, email addresses,
phone numbers, or any other supported data format.

**QR Code Generation:** Utilize a Python library such as qrcode or pyqrcode to generate QR code images based on the user-input data. These libraries should support 
various data types and customization options, such as specifying the size, color, and error correction level of the QR code.

**Image Display:** Display the generated QR code image within the application window or save it to a file on the user's device.
Provide options for users to choose the output format (e.g., PNG, JPG, SVG) and file location.
